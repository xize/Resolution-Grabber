# Resolution-Grabber
A ported version from https://github.com/xize/GTA-RES-GRABBER written in c#

this program will be used as a debug program, to see what the resolution is between the native windows api
and the called window.

Unlike GTA RES GRABBER this version allows you to check this with every window not just the gta game only.

Feel free to contribute, if you want to add a feature into this.
